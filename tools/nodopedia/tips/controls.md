# Switching between Control Methods
You can control Game Builder Garage with the following methods:

- Touch Controls
- Control Stick Pointer
- Motion-Control Pointer
- Mouse

In the pause menu's control settings, you can configure settings for both TV mode controls and handheld/tabletop mode controls.<br>

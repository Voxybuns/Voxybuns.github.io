        <p>Between June 2021 and March 2022, Nintendo has released 39 weekly sample games created with Game Builder Garage. Each of those samples (called "programming set-ups") showcased various game mechanics, and explained how to program them in your own creations.</p>
        <p>Despite all set-ups getting localized and uploaded to the Game Builder Garage servers, Japan was the only region to consistently release them through a dedicated news channel. To help preserve them and make them easier to access, I've compiled all of them onto this very page, along with short descriptions of what they contain.</p>
        <p>I hope you'll find them useful in your own game creation process!</p>

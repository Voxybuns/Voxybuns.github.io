# Object Connections Can Be Broken
It's possible for connected objects to be separated when a strong force is applied to them. The heavier and faster the object, the greater the force. To make them harder to separate, you'll need to adjust either the speed, the size, or both!

# Connected Objects and the Solid Property
Connected objects will not collide with each other, even if Solid is enabled for both.<br>
However, if you connect objects with the String Connector Nodon, and Solid is disabled in the String Connector Nodon's settings, objects connected at either end will collide, if Solid is enabled for those objects.

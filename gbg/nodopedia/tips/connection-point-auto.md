# About Automatic Connection Points
If Connection Point is set to Auto, objects will be connected via the faces that are closest to each other.<br>
If the objects are overlapping, it'll take the position into account as well.

# When Objects Are Connected via Connector Nodon
When two objects are connected via connector Nodon such as the Slide-Connector Nodon, the Free-Slide-Connector Nodon, the Hinge-Connector Nodon, or the String-Connector Nodon, the connection point will be determined from the location of the connector Nodon.

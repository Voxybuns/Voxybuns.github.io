# Settings
## Properties
Sets the properties of objects.

Visible, Solid, Destructive, and Destructible can be enabled or disabled.<br>
Movable is always enabled.<br>
Play Sound When Hit/Destroyed? is always set to Don't play.<br>
Can Be Grabbed by Hand Nodon? is always set to Can't be grabbed.

If Solid is disabled, the string itself won't be treated as solid, and the two objects attached to it at either end will be treated as being in separate groups, even though they belong to the same group. Usually, objects connected within the same group won't collide with each other, even when set to Solid. However, this case is an exception.

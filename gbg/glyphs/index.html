        <p>Want to add some flair to your in-game tutorials? Why not display the icon of the buttons you want the player to press? On this page, you'll find two methods to display controller glyphs in your next Game Builder Garage creation!</p>

        <spacer-block class="h-400"></spacer-block>

        <h2 class="text-teal">Text-Object method</h2>
        <spacer-block class="h-50"></spacer-block>
        <p>For this method, you'll need to download a special game template. This template, created with help from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjdquv22VPfwetg0JBV_JcA">Borri</a> contains Text-Object Nodon which display special characters that cannot be typed through normal means. The downside of this method is that you'll need to use the template as the starting point to your game, meaning you can't add those glyphs to an existing project.</p>
        <p>To see this method in action, check out this awesome video by my good friend Dom!</p>

        <spacer-block class="h-200"></spacer-block>

        <p>The template can be downloaded using the following game code: <strong>G 002 5X4 XPR</strong>. Make a copy of the game, and you're ready to go! Duplicate the Text-Object Nodon as needed, and edit them to label the commands in your game. Don't forget to remove everything you don't need!</p>

        <spacer-block class="h-400"></spacer-block>

        <h2 class="text-teal">AGTD method</h2>
        <spacer-block class="h-50"></spacer-block>
        <p>This method uses AGTD, an Arduino script by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjdquv22VPfwetg0JBV_JcA">Borri</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Scrubz_GBG/">Scrubz</a> which allows textures to be drawn automatically inside of Game Builder Garage using an Arduino microcontroller.</p>
        <p>To use this method, you'll need the advanced AGTD setup, which uses the SD card readers. For more details, check out <a href="https://youtu.be/PTDiTS-Exjk">this other video</a> by Dom. Download the .zip archive below and copy the glyphs you need onto the root of the SD card. Insert the SD card into the Arduino setup, and start the script to import them in your project.</p>

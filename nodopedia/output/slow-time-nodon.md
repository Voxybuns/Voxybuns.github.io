        <p>Slows down time according to the input value received at this port.<br />The larger the value, the stronger the effect of the slowdown. A value of 1.00 will slow time down to one thousandth of the normal speed, practically stopping it altogether.<br />The slowdown only affects the movement of objects. Other operations such as calculations, text and number displays, and Timer Nodon actions will work as usual.</p>

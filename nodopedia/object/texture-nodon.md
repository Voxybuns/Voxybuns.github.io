        <p>This is a special type of port that physically links objects generated by Nodon on the game screen.

<h1>Settings</h1>
<h2>Texture Face</h2>
<p>Sets the face of the connected object that will display the image.<br />You can choose from X-, X+, Y-, Y+, Z-, Z+, X Center, Y Center, or Z Center.<br /><br />If multiple textures are connected to the same object and set to the same texture face, only one texture will be displayed.<br /><br />If it's connected to a fancy object, a person, car, or UFO, the object itself won't display. All you'll see will be the image mapped on to the transparent frame, which could be either a cuboid, cylinder, or sphere.<br /><br />If you select any of the center options, the image won't display on the object's surface but on a transparent plane through the center of the object.<br /><br />When connected to the World Nodon, the center options will be unavailable.<br /><br />This setting is ineffective when not connected to an object. It'll display an image facing the camera, disregarding the settings.</p>
<h2>Size</h2>
<p>Sets the size of the image.<br />The image will be stretched or shrunk according to the size set and then applied<br />as a texture.<br />If the image is smaller than the face that it's applied to, it'll repeat. If the image is larger, the parts that don't fit will be discarded.<br />X and Y can both be set to between 0.10 and 10.00.</p>
<h2>Position</h2>
<p>When nothing is connected, the set image will display.<br />When connected, it has no effect.</p>
<p>X, Y, and Z can each be set to between -100.00 and 100.00.<br />Measured in meters.</p>
<h2>Rotation</h2>
<p>Sets rotation for the image so you can display it at an angle.</p>
<p>Can be set between -180.00° and 180.00°.</p>
<h2>Texture Canvas</h2>
<p>Draw the picture that you want to display.<br />The size is 64 x 64 pixels.</p>

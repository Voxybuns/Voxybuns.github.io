<h2>Size</h2>
<p>Sets the size of an object.<br />When the object's shape is set to Box, you'll be able to set the X, Y, and Z<br />dimensions separately.<br />When the object's shape is set to Cylinder, the ratio between X and Z will be fixed, but their ratios to Y can be adjusted.<br />When the object's shape is set to Sphere, the ratio between X, Y, and Z will be fixed.<br /><br />X, Y, and Z can be set to between 0.10 and 10.00. Measured in meters.</p>
<h2>Position</h2>
<p>Determines the position of the object at the time of game start or after a reset.<br />X, Y, and Z can each be set to between -100.00 and 100.00.<br />Measured in meters.<br />However, if Movable is enabled and the world's shape is set to Plane, Dome, Cuboid, or Cylinder, the Y value will be adjusted so that objects lower than Y: 0 aren't embedded into the ground.</p>
<h2>Rotation</h2>
<p>Sets the orientation of the object at game start or after a reset.<br />The X, Y, and Z axes can each be set between -180.00Â° and 180.00Â°.</p>

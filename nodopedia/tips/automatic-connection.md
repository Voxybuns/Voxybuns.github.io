<h1>About Automatic Connection Points</h1>
<p>If Connection Point is set to Auto, objects will be connected via the faces that are closest to each other.<br />If the objects are overlapping, it'll take the position into account as well.</p>
<h1>When Objects Are Connected via Connector Nodon</h1>
<p>When two objects are connected via connector Nodon such as the Slide-Connector Nodon, the Free-Slide-Connector Nodon, the Hinge-Connector Nodon, or the String-Connector Nodon, the connection point will be determined from the location of the connector Nodon.</p>

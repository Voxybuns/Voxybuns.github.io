<h1>Limits per Game</h1>
<p>Each game you create has a maximum limit of 512 Nodon and 1024 connections.<br />You can check how many you have used up in the pause menu.</p>
<h1>Limits of Input and Output Ports</h1>
<p>A single input port or output port can take up to 16 connections.</p>
<h1>Connection Limit</h1>
<p>An upper connection port can generally accept up to eight connections. However, the upper connection ports of the String Connector Nodon, Head Nodon, and Hand Nodon can only accept one connection.<br />A lower connection port typically only accepts one connection, but the Texture Nodon's port can accept up to eight. </p>
<h1>Connection Group Limit</h1>
<p>Nodon that are physically connected (via the connection port) contiguously to each other are called a connection group.<br />You can have up to 32 Nodon in a single connection group. However, the maximum length of consecutive Nodon in a row is 17. (Texture Nodon are not included in this count.)<br />Also, certain combinations of Nodon might prevent Nodon from connecting directly to each other.<br /></p>

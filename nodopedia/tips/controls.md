<h1>Switching between Control Methods</h1>
<p>You can control Game Builder Garage with the following methods:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>Touch Controls</li>
  <li>Control Stick Pointer</li>
  <li>Motion-Control Pointer</li>
  <li>Mouse</li>
</ul>
<p>In the pause menu's control settings, you can configure settings for both TV mode controls and handheld/tabletop mode controls.<br />If a USB mouse is connected, the game will switch to mouse controls automatically.</p>

<h1>Performance Drops</h1>
<p>Game Builder Garage runs at 60 frames per second.<br />However, having very complex mechanisms and many moving objects can cause this to drop to 30 or 20 frames per second. All processes including calculation and visual display will slow down, and the gameplay performance will drop.<br />If this happens while you are checking a game, a ● will appear in the top right of the screen.<br /></p>
<h1>Deleting Objects</h1>
<p>Colliding with many objects at the same time can cause a severe drop in performance. Game Builder Garage will automatically delete objects to counter this. When this happens, a ▲ will appear in the top right of the screen.</p>
<h2>Delay Deletion by Locking</h2>
<p>You can lock a Nodon by selecting it and then the key symbol.<br />Locking a Nodon prevents you from affecting it on the program screen by moving it, changing its size, or rotating it. It also pushes it to the back of the order in which objects are deleted.</p>
<h1>Automatically Adjusting Color and Brightness</h1>
<p>The color and brightness may be adjusted automatically to compensate for activity on-screen.</p>

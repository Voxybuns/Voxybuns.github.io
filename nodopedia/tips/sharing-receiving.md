<h1>Sharing and Receiving</h1>
<p>Sharing and receiving features will allow you to share or receive games with people all over the world using the internet or with nearby people using local communication.<br />A Nintendo Switch Online membership is required to share or receive games on the internet.</p>
<h1>Things to Consider When Sharing Games</h1>

<p>Please be mindful of the following points when sharing games online.</p>
<ul class="bullet" style="margin-bottom: 1rem">
  <li>The game's content and title, and your user name (the nickname you use on your Nintendo Switch console) will be shared with many people all over the world.<br /><ul><li>Anyone who knows the game ID of a game can play, copy, modify, and reshare it.</li></ul></li>
  <li>Please don't share any games that include any of the following content.<br /><ul><li>Illegal content, personal information, content that violates someone else's rights, has fast flashing lights, or any other content that could make others feel uncomfortable.</li></ul></li>
  <li>The terms of the Nintendo Account User Agreement apply to any games that are shared online. Games that violate any of these terms will be deleted.</li>
  <li>In general, games will be deleted from the server 365 days after they were shared.<ul><li>Whenever someone receives your game, however, the automatic deletion date is reset. The game will then be deleted from the server 365 days after it was last received.</li></ul></li>
  <li>Note that when a game is deleted from the server, it is not deleted from the save data of players who have already received the game.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sharing with Local Communication</h2>
<p>Please be mindful of the following points when sharing games locally.</p>
<ul class="bullet" style="margin-bottom: 1rem">
  <li>The game's content and title, as well as your user name (the nickname you use on your Nintendo Switch console) will be shared with the nearby people who receive your game.<br /><ul><li>Anyone who receives your game can play, copy, modify, and reshare it.</li></ul></li>

</ul>
<h1>Reporting Received Games</h1>
<p>If you believe that any games that you receive online violate the terms of the Nintendo Account User Agreement, it's possible to report them.<br />Reports of violations will be sent to Nintendo, not to the person that shared the game. Games that violate the terms of the Nintendo Account User Agreement will be removed.<br />When making a report, please also send a screenshot of the most relevant part of the game. This image will be used to determine whether or not the game is in violation of the terms, so please make the report at a point when the specific violating content is pictured on the screen.</p>
